          <h2 role="heading" aria-level="2">What automatic enrolment means for you</h2>
          <p>Automatic enrolment involves two key changes that are likely to affect you.</p>          
          <p>First, it means that joining a workplace pension scheme becomes that much easier. Rather than having to take steps to join, under automatic enrolment most workers will be signed up as a matter of course (though you can opt out if you want to).</p>
          <p>Second, it makes saving into a pension more financially attractive by making it compulsory for employers to pay into eligible workers’ pension schemes. A lot of employers were already doing this, but now all have to.</p>
          <p>The reason these changes are being introduced is that too few of us are saving as much as we should for retirement. In general, there’s a big gap between the kind of lifestyle we hope to enjoy in retirement and the kind of lifestyle that we’re on track to be <a href="https://www.google.com" target="_blank" role="link">able to afford</a>.</p>

          <h2 role="heading" aria-level="2">Types of mortgage</h2>
          <p>Buy-to-let (BTL) mortgages are for landlords who buy property to rent it out. The rules around buy-to-let mortgages are similar to those around regular mortgages, but there are some key differences. <a href="http://cnn.com" role="link" target="_blank">Read on</a> for more information about how they work, how to get one and what mistakes to avoid.</p>    
          <p>Most of the big banks and some specialist lenders offer BTL mortgages. It’s a good idea to talk to a mortgage broker before you take out a buy-to-let mortgage, as they will help you choose the most suitable deal for you.</p>

          <h2 role="heading" aria-level="2">Do you need travel insurance?</h2>
          <p>The average cost for overseas medical treatment is £2,040, but can be much higher.</p>
          <p>For example, in one case treating multiple fractures and an artery tear in the USA, a British citizen was forced to take an air ambulance back to the UK. The cost of the treatment and transport was close to £500,000.</p> 
          <p>If you’re over 65 or have a medical condition, you might need specialist insurance. If you have a medical condition you have to tell your insurer if asked or risk invalidating your insurance policy. When you buy insurance you must answer all questions about your circumstances and health honestly. You have to include everything, even if you think it’s not important, for example taking regular tablets for high blood pressure or angina. If you don’t your policy won’t be valid.</p>

          <p>Choosing between savings options is easier than it looks. There are hundreds of accounts, but only a few types of account – some for easy access to emergency funds, some for saving regularly and some for growing your money. Take a look at the table to see which suits you best.</p>
